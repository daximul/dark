## Information

These tutorials assume that you're comfortable with Roblox and the Lua scripting language.

The admin is just lots of code I probably stole that I use to improve my knowledge of lua.

The script downloads itself incase HttpGet or GitHub just breaks.

This is a file based admin system using `import` (you will learn about it later).

!!! note "Known Supported Executors"
	[Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to), [Scriptware](https://script-ware.com), [KRNL](https://krnl.place)

	The following executors have been confirmed to be able to run the script.

## Executing the Script

	1. Open your executor.
	2. Copy the code from [Loader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daximul/dav2/main/loadstring/loader.lua) or [Loadstring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daximul/dav2/main/loadstring/script.lua).
	3. Paste the code into the executor's execution box.
