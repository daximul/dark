## Information

Everything you will be reading here will assume that you're comfortable with Roblox and the Lua scripting language.

The admin is just lots of code I probably stole that I use to improve my knowledge of Lua.

The script downloads itself in case HttpGet or GitHub breaks.

This is a file-based admin system using `import` (you will learn about it later).

!!! note "Known Supported Executors"
	[Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to), [Scriptware](https://script-ware.com), [KRNL](https://krnl.place)

	The following executors have been confirmed to be able to run the script.

## Why is the loader recommended

I recommend the [loader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daximul/dav2/main/loadstring/loader.lua) instead of the [loadstring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daximul/dav2/main/loadstring/script.lua) because if you have already executed the admin before something like a rare case of GitHub going down, you can still execute the script.

## Executing the Script

!!! example "Steps"
	1. Open your executor.
	2. Copy the code from [Loader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daximul/dav2/main/loadstring/loader.lua) or [Loadstring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daximul/dav2/main/loadstring/script.lua).
	3. Paste the code into the executor's execution box.
	4. Press on `Execute`.
	5. Enjoy (the default prefix is `;`).

	Congratulations, you did it!
